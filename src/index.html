            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have a fascination for software reverse engineering, exploit development, and QoL scripting.</p>
            <p>Learning Ghidra was the  opening act for my interest. I had taken a reverse engineering class in college, and I had only limited knowledge about the subject
                and did not know what I was getting into. I was taken through the stages of learning what decompiled C code looks like, assembly code and how it works, and how to write scripts for ghidra to make my life easier.
                Since then, I have improved my skills and begun working on RE as a career. Reversing firmware, network connections, and even using debugging / reading memory to assist in my assumptions has been a great learning experience.
                I am excited to continue learning, refining my skills, and applying them to real world problems.
