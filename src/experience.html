                        <p>This was my first full-time position that I had taken after graduating from college. I started as a pure software developer tasked with virtualizing hardware components and how they acted.
                            I took power pc firmware and manuals and created C++ classes that represented them in code. I was mainly in charge of working on timing and the interrupt controller of both the CPU and FPGA.
                            I learned a lot about hardware and debugging memory addresses as well as reverse engineering real hardware firmware. After working on this I pivoted into more of a red teamer. I helped out with
                            penetration test assessments and would help analyze the data that came from them. While continueing to work on the red team, I began assisting with cybersecurity risk studies and assessing systems for where they are vulnerable.
                            We would learn as much as we could about the system and generate a report to the customer that showed how they were vulnerable and mitigation strategies.
                        </p>
                        <p>Throughout all of my time here I have been able to learn a <strong>TON</strong> about red teaming, software development in a large professonal setting, risk, and business development and I am excited to learn more.</p>
